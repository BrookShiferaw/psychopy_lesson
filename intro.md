In psychology and neuroscience, we conduct experiments. These experiments have a stimulus. The stimulus might be the same, or it might differ. Regardless, there will be many *repititions* of the stimulus to get an average response. The experiments record some kind of respose. This response might be acuracy, reaction time, or some kind of neural potential for example.

The flow of an experimental design might look like this:


In Psychopy, this experimental flow would look like this: 

Let's continue to see how.
